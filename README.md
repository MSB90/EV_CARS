# Electric Car Data Analysis Project
Welcome to my inaugural project, the Electric Car Data Analysis Showcase. Within this repository, I embark on a journey into the world of data analysis using SQL. By delving into a dataset containing electric car specifications, I aim to illustrate my early foray into the realm of data manipulation.

## Project Overview
This project revolves around an in-depth analysis of a dataset containing detailed specifications of electric car models. By leveraging my SQL skills, I extract valuable insights from the data to answer specific questions related to electric vehicles.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes attributes such as brand, model, acceleration time, top speed, range, efficiency, charging options, powertrain, plug type, body style, segment, seats, and price for various electric car models.

## Project Goals
My primary goal in this project is to showcase my SQL skills by:

Data Exploration: Gaining a deep understanding of the dataset's structure and content.

Querying: Crafting insightful SQL queries to extract specific information from the dataset.

Analysis: Analyzing the dataset to answer targeted questions about electric car specifications.

Reporting: Presenting my findings through well-organized, easy-to-understand reports.

## Project Steps
Data Import: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/geoffnel/evs-one-electric-vehicle-dataset into a MySQL Workbench as a database.

Data Exploration: Examine the dataset's schema, identifying key attributes for analysis.

SQL Queries: Formulate a series of SQL queries to address questions such as average acceleration, top speed distribution, and more.

Results: Present the results of each query with clear explanations and contextual insights.

## Example Questions Explored
What is the average acceleration time for all-electric cars?
Which car model has the highest top speed?
How does the efficiency vary across different body styles?
What is the distribution of ranges among various segments?
